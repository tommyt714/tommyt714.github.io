<h1>Welcome</h1>
<p>Thanks for checking out my personal website!  My name is Tommy Thompson, and I'm a licensed Professional Environmental Engineer, 
   passionate coder, and home mixologist living in the Greater Philadelphia area.  I'm currently looking to make the complete career
   metamorphosis into Software Development/Data Analytics because silently screaming and cursing at my computer screen may well be
   the only kind of productivity that sparks true joy in me.  Until I achieve that dream, I'll keep toying around on here and on
   Kaggle.com to try to make sense of the world while simultaneously changing it for the better.<br><br>
   &emsp; &nbsp;- Tommy</p>

   <br>
   <p>My name is Tommy Thompson, and I'm a licensed Professional Environmental Engineer, 
      passionate coder, and home mixologist living in the Greater Philadelphia area.  I'm currently looking to make the complete career
      metamorphosis into Software Development/Data Analytics because silently screaming and cursing at my computer screen may well be
      the only kind of productivity that sparks true joy in me.  Until I achieve that dream, I'll keep toying around on here and on
      Kaggle.com to try to make sense of the world while simultaneously changing it for the better.
